**ðŸŽ¨ Design Decisions & Trade-offs**

Area	                                Decision/Trade-off

Drag & Drop	               Only enabled when filter is set to "All" to avoid confusing UX

Persistence	               Used localStorage for simplicity instead of setting up a backend

Animations	               Used CSS transform for better performance (GPU-accelerated)

Theme Design	           Custom light/dark theme using MUI with gradients and glassmorphism-style effects

Component Structure	       Reusable TaskItem, TaskForm, and Header components for clarity
